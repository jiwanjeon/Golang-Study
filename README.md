What is Go? Go is a next-generation, open-source programming language created by Google for building systems, web, and other applications. This course is designed to help developers get started with Go, covering its core language elements and syntax. David Gassner introduces tools and skills used in a Go workflowâ€”including Go Playground, an online tool that takes Go development off the desktop. He also covers basic programming tasks: managing values, using math operators, storing values as complex types, and managing program flow. Plus, learn how to create reusable Go code, read and write files, and make simple web requests.
